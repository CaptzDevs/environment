# Simulation Environments

A project for creating and running **agent-based simulations** in configurable environments. This simulation framework allows agents to interact, move, reproduce, eat, and respond to environmental factors. It is designed to be **extensible, modular, and easy to customize**.

## Overview

This simulation environment models **agents in a 2D world**. Each agent has properties like position, size, and behaviors such as reproduction, eating, attacking, and social interaction. The environment handles **collision detection, distance calculations, and agent interactions** to simulate realistic dynamics.

---

## Features

- **Agent-based simulation**: Each agent acts independently based on its properties and environment.
- **Behavior system**: Modular behaviors including reproduction, mating drive, feeding, and attacking.
- **Collision detection**: Support for circles and rectangles.
- **Distance-based interactions**: Agents react to proximity of other agents.
- **Extensible structure**: Easily add new behaviors or environmental rules.
- **Configurable parameters**: Control speed, visibility, cooldowns, and other agent attributes.
